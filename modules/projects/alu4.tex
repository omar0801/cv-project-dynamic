\begin{rSubsection}{4-bit ALU and Processor Design on FPGA} {Oct. 2022 - Jan. 2023}{Digital Electronics Coursework}{}
\item Constructed a 4-bit ALU and processor using Verilog and Quartus Prime, simulating logic with Questa
\item Composed modular components including MUX2, MUX3, Full Adder, Registers, and Control Logic for ALU4
\item Validated operations (AND, OR, ADD, SUB) through waveform analysis and tested results on FPGA board
