\begin{rSubsection}{Pipeline‑Inspection System on DE10‑Lite FPGA} {Feb. 2024 - May 2024}{Digital Electronics Project}{}
\item Designed a pipeline inspection system incorporating a location tracker, odometer, device ID, and wall thickness
\item Integrated ultrasonic sensors, SPI-based accelerometer, digital memory technology, and a user-configured GUI
\item Simulated the system using Verilog test benches and conducted onboard tests to validate the design on FPGA
